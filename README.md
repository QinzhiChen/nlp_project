# Natural Language Processing - Repository main programming language predictor


## Project description:

- We were able to programatically scrape some of the most popular repositories on Github - 490 to be exact, and from them collect the repository name, main programming language used, and the content of the README file from each. 

- All the data collected was compiled into a DataFrame with the anticipation that we will be able to glean from it what the main programming language is of the repository via Natural Language Processing methods on the corresponding README file content.

- While the data we collected is static, the Github repositories are dynamic and ever-changing. Therefore is important to note the data was collected from these 490 repositories on the morning of October 17, 2022.


## Project goal

- The stated goal of this project is to predict the main progamming language of a repository on Github based on the README file contents.


## How to repeat this work

- You will need to pull down all files in this repository into the working directory in order for the workbook to run top down without issue.
